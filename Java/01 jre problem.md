### Re-install jdk1.8
- I find a strange phenomenon, when you intall jdk-8u181-windows-x64.exe, and you didn't use the folder recommended by default setting (`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_181\`)
- There will be two JRE(Java Runtime Environment) installed.
- First JRE will be placed at `C:\your-own-folder\jre`
- Second JRE will be placed at `C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_181`
- And it's even stranger when I found extra java excutable files.
    - I check the environemnt variables
    - Path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Oracle\Java\javapath`
    - There are three java exe file in the folder (java.exe, javaw.exe, javaws.exe )
- Why did they do that?
    - I found that when you input `java -version` in terminal window, you may not using the JRE from the folder you had choosen, but the second JRE folder.
    - People called the second JRE "Public JRE", and it register the JRE to the system and broser, not the developer.
    - The JDK-install-exe-file regist the second JRE to the computer system, you can use `java -version` everywhere without setting the environment variable.
    - Because the install file already did that, it had setted `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Oracle\Java\javapath` to the Path variable.
- Actually, you can remove the Second JRE by deleting the folderes and remove the varable in Path. Then you could set your own environment variables.
    - Be careful, if you are not a veteran, don't do that!
